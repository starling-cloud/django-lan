**Django LAN** is a multichannel identity framework.

**Django LAN** is an open-source project by [Starling Associates](https://www.starling.associates "Starling Associates website").




To develop a project with functionality similar to Ubiquiti’s management consoles, which are known for their robust network management and monitoring capabilities, you would need to build a comprehensive Django application that includes several key components: models for device tracking, user interface for real-time updates, APIs for device communication, and potentially, real-time monitoring tools.

Key Components
 1. Models: You’ll need a series of Django models to represent the network devices, configurations, users, and potentially logs for changes and status updates.
 2. REST API: For dynamic interaction between the frontend and the backend, especially for configurations and monitoring.
 3. WebSocket: For real-time status updates to the dashboard.
 4. Authentication: To manage user access and roles.
 5. Task Scheduling: For routine checks and updates.

Suggested Django Models

Here’s a conceptual breakdown of the models you might consider:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class NetworkDevice(models.Model):
    """
    Model to represent a network device such as routers, switches, and wireless access points.
    """
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
    mac_address = models.CharField(max_length=17, unique=True)
    device_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, default='active')  # active, inactive, maintenance

class DeviceConfiguration(models.Model):
    """
    Stores configuration for each device.
    """
    device = models.ForeignKey(NetworkDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    configuration = models.TextField()
    applied = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    applied_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

class UserActivityLog(models.Model):
    """
    Log user activities for auditing and troubleshooting.
    """
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Alert(models.Model):
    """
    Alerts generated by network monitoring tools or by system thresholds.
    """
    message = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    alert_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # Informational, Warning, Critical
    device = models.ForeignKey(NetworkDevice, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

Additional Functionality
 1. REST API:
 • Use Django REST Framework to create an API that allows users to retrieve, update, and delete devices and configurations.
 • Endpoint to fetch real-time data and status updates.
 2. Real-Time Updates:
 • Implement WebSocket using channels to send real-time updates to the UI regarding device status, alerts, etc.
 3. Task Scheduling:
 • Use Celery with Django to perform periodic tasks such as scanning the network, checking device status, applying configurations, or fetching updates.
 4. User Interface:
 • Develop a React or Angular frontend that interacts with the Django backend via REST API and WebSockets.
 • Dynamic dashboards for network status, device management, alerts, and logs.
 5. Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate Django’s authentication system to manage user sessions.
 • Define roles and permissions for different types of users (admin, user, guest).

Next Steps
 1. Development Plan: Break down the project into phases, starting with backend models and API development before moving on to frontend and real-time features.
 2. Testing: Ensure rigorous testing, especially integration tests to cover the interactions between components.
 3. Deployment: Plan for a scalable deployment using Docker and Kubernetes if expected traffic and data volume are high.
 4. Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation for API usage, model relationships, and frontend integration.

This approach lays a solid foundation for building a network management system similar to Ubiquiti’s management consoles, focusing on scalability, real-time functionality, and robust data management.
